    <h1>Advanced Precision Machining: Engineering Standards & Material Data</h1>
    <p>Authored by: Evan (Mechatronics Specialist since 2001)</p>
    
    <h2>1. Dimensional Tolerances in 5-Axis Milling</h2>
    <p>For high-precision aerospace and medical components, achieving repeatable tolerances of ±0.01mm requires not only advanced PLC control but also rigorous thermal compensation strategies.</p>

    <h2>2. Stainless Steel Machinability Indices</h2>
    <p>When selecting materials for corrosion-resistant parts, engineers must evaluate the balance between tensile strength and tool wear. Our recent testing confirms that optimized feed rates can significantly reduce the overhead of 316L fabrication.</p>
